# MovieFlix97


A responsive web application that displays a [`virtualized`](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/virtual-lists) list of movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. The app shows top movies for each year and users can filter by genre.

**used React + React Virtuoso + CSS**


- Enhanced rendering performance by implementing virtualized rendering for large data sets. 
- Implemented smooth scrolling behavior to load more movies as the user scrolls in any direction (from 2010 to currentYear)

⚠️ 🚧 Feature in Progress : 
- loading movies of previous year when user scrolls up  (logic commented / removed )


> Encountered scroll jump issues while trying to load the previous year's movie list. To ensure a smoother and more responsive user experience had to optimize the code by streamlining certain logic and reducing unnecessary computations related to the movie list retrieval and rendering.
